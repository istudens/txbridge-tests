---------  JBossTS TxBridge Tests
Author: Jonathan Halliday <jonathan.halliday@redhat.com>
Author: Ivo Studensky <istudens@redhat.com>

These tests have been derived from txbridge tests of JBOSSTS_4_16. The original tests 
can be found here:
http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/labs/labs/jbosstm/branches/JBOSSTS_4_16/txbridge/tests/

The new tests are powered by Maven + Arquillian. The tests have been changed to work 
on AS7 and JUnit test classes have been renamed to have distinct names in order to 
allow being run by Surefire separately.


--- Requirements:
1. apache maven tool
2. installed AS7

--- Steps to run:

1. git clone git@github.com:istudens/txbridge-tests.git
2. cd txbridge-tests
3. export JBOSS_HOME=<path to AS7>
4. mvn clean test
